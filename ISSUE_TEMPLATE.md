Having a problem? Bummer. Watcher is under constant development, so bear with us while we sort this out.

Meanwhile, you can help us get this fixed more quickly by following this format:

#### What happened?

#### How can I reproduce this?

#### What else do I need to know?
Operating system, python version, etc?

Including logs of the event are often neccessary to find out exactly what is going on.
If the log section is short feel free to post is here, but make sure to remove any personal information (ie IP address) and remove any references to movie or release titles.
If the logs are long, or require release title names to troubleshoot, submit an issue here, then send the logs to watchernzb@gmail.com.
Put a link to your issue in the email body so we know exactly who it belongs to.
